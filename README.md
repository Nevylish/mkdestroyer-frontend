# MK Guilds Destroyer - Front End
[![Netlify Status](https://api.netlify.com/api/v1/badges/a00c7e75-3685-4607-aead-3aa24ffa343c/deploy-status)](https://app.netlify.com/sites/mkdestroyer/deploys)[![License: MPL 2.0](https://img.shields.io/badge/License-MPL_2.0-brightgreen.svg)](https://opensource.org/licenses/MPL-2.0)

Created to raise awareness among Discord server managers about malicious individuals, 
MK Destroyer is a website that can harm a Discord server, particularly by deleting all channels/roles and creating countless new ones infinitely by spamming inside. 
This is ONLY the Front-End part, so it's harmless.

The website uses WebSocket to communicate with the backend, however, the backend code will remain private to prevent its misuse and avoid any issues with Discord or Github.

Made with Typescript + Vite + React + Chakra UI

(*I am not a front-end developer, and most of all, the goal is not to create a clean project, but just something that can be used once every three years or so.*)
